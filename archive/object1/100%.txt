CENTRAL ARCHIVAL COMMITTEE — FILE ACCESS
ITEM ID: CAC-B04-312
CLASSIFICATION: Contained Bio-Mechanical Entity
ASSIGNED FACILITY: Site 9 — Media Anomaly Storage
STATUS: Active / Contained
------------------------------------------------------------
CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL
- House the unit in a dimly lit media containment room.
- No direct sunlight. No active audio equipment beyond the monitor.
- Maintain continuous power. Power loss beyond 30 seconds triggers aggressive activity.
- Approved use: testing and administrative tasks only.
- Prohibited: touching the display surface, striking the casing, or attempting to open it.
- Approved offerings: processed sugars, raw meat, distilled water placed near ventilation slits.
------------------------------------------------------------
ARTIFACT DESCRIPTION
CAC-B04-312 is a CRT monitor of unknown manufacture. The casing resembles late-1990s consumer hardware; internal components do not match known designs. The device is significantly heavier than expected and functions normally when connected to compatible systems.

Inside the casing resides a living organism.
------------------------------------------------------------
CONTAINED ORGANISM DESCRIPTION
A soft-bodied, tentacled entity occupies the internal structure of the monitor, consistent with hermit-crab-like habitation behavior. Appendages are intermittently visible through ventilation gaps and, rarely, beneath the display glass. Internal scans show the organism has integrated around key components, rerouting circuitry through its own tissue without disrupting functionality.

The monitor is not alive. The organism is.
------------------------------------------------------------
BEHAVIORAL NOTES
Positive response to:
- Food placement near the casing
- Gentle tapping on the monitor frame
- Continuous power supply
- Static images or low-motion visuals

Negative response to:
- Attempts to open or damage the casing
- Hands placed against the display surface
- Sudden loss of power
- Prolonged display of its own reflection

Agitation manifests as visible tentacle movement beneath the glass, image warping, and localized heat buildup.
------------------------------------------------------------
INCIDENT REPORT 9-61
A technician placed a palm against the active display surface. The screen showed a distorted reflection followed by internal movement inconsistent with electrical interference. The technician was later found with severe neurological trauma and internal hemorrhaging localized to the contact arm. No external wounds were observed. Review indicates defensive appendage extension through the display’s electromagnetic field. Direct contact with the screen is now classified as lethal.
------------------------------------------------------------
ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS
- When powered down for extended periods, faint internal movement is audible.
- If left unplugged for longer than 30 seconds, appendages attempt to exit through ventilation openings.
- Re-powering causes immediate retreat.
------------------------------------------------------------
ARCHIVAL NOTE
The monitor is not haunted. It is occupied.
The organism does not understand what a monitor is—only that it is safe, warm, and full of moving light.
When the screen is on, the creature is calm.
When the screen goes dark, it starts to look for somewhere else to live.
