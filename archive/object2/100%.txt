CENTRAL ARCHIVAL COMMITTEE — FILE ACCESS
ITEM ID: CAC-A17-049
CLASSIFICATION: High Risk Temporal Artifact
ASSIGNED FACILITY: Site 14 — Temporal Observation Wing
STATUS: Active / Contained
------------------------------------------------------------
CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL
- Store the unit in a sound-insulated archival locker constructed from non-reflective composite material.
- Device must remain powered off unless an observation cycle is formally approved by the Site 14 Oversight Panel.
- Minimum of two observers required for all interactions. No solo operation permitted.
- At least one independent real-time recording device must be active during use.
- Prohibited: aiming the unit at reflective surfaces, live monitors, or its own playback screen.
- If displayed footage diverges from observed reality by more than 8 seconds, abort the cycle immediately and return the device to containment.
------------------------------------------------------------
ARTIFACT DESCRIPTION
CAC-A17-049 is a handheld consumer camcorder of indeterminate origin. The casing shows cosmetic wear consistent with prolonged personal use. Internal components do not correspond to any known manufacturer, and no serial numbers, firmware identifiers, or recoverable metadata have been identified.

When powered on, the device displays and records events that have not yet occurred.
------------------------------------------------------------
ANOMALOUS PROPERTIES
The camcorder’s viewfinder presents reality between 3 and 7 seconds ahead of the present moment. Audio is synchronized with the displayed footage. The effect resembles a delayed live feed, as though upcoming events are preloaded before occurring.

The temporal offset is variable. During periods of rapid movement, emotional stress, or imminent bodily harm, the delay has extended to as much as 12 seconds.

The device does not generate hypothetical outcomes. All recorded footage represents events that will occur exactly as shown.
------------------------------------------------------------
BEHAVIORAL NOTES
- Once an individual observes an event through the device’s display, the recorded outcome becomes unavoidable.
- Attempts to prevent or alter recorded events consistently fail through indirect means such as involuntary physical response, mechanical malfunction, or coincidental environmental interference.
- Subjects report a growing sensation of detachment with prolonged viewing, commonly described as “lagging behind reality.”
- CAC-A17-049 has never displayed footage in which it is destroyed, disabled, or rendered inoperable.
------------------------------------------------------------
INCIDENT REPORT 14-77
During a controlled test, CAC-A17-049 was positioned facing a sealed observation door. Playback footage showed the door opening, followed by the camcorder falling forward and impacting the floor lens-first.

Personnel attempted to terminate the observation remotely prior to the recorded timestamp. The device continued operating despite being disconnected from its power source.

At the recorded moment, the door opened. No personnel entered the room. The camcorder fell regardless.

Frame-by-frame analysis revealed a brief reflection in the camcorder lens immediately before impact. The angle indicates the device was already on the floor, recording upward—an impossible perspective given its placement at the time.

Testing involving closed doors was suspended.
------------------------------------------------------------
ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS
- When activated in empty rooms, the device frequently displays an individual entering frame shortly before the unit is powered off.
- Individuals shown in these recordings are consistently the personnel assigned to end the observation cycle.
- No verified instance exists of the device displaying an event that failed to occur.
------------------------------------------------------------
ARCHIVAL NOTE
CAC-A17-049 does not predict the future.
It displays events that have already committed to occurring.
By the time they are observed, reality is no longer waiting to be decided.
